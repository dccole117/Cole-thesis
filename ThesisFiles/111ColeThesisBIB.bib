@article{DelHaye2007,
abstract = {Optical frequency combs provide equidistant frequency markers in the infrared, visible and ultraviolet, and can be used to link an unknown optical frequency to a radio or microwave frequency reference. Since their inception, frequency combs have triggered substantial advances in optical frequency metrology and precision measurements and in applications such as broadband laser-based gas sensing and molecular fingerprinting. Early work generated frequency combs by intra-cavity phase modulation; subsequently, frequency combs have been generated using the comb-like mode structure of mode-locked lasers, whose repetition rate and carrier envelope phase can be stabilized. Here we report a substantially different approach to comb generation, in which equally spaced frequency markers are produced by the interaction between a continuous-wave pump laser of a known frequency with the modes of a monolithic ultra-high-Q microresonator via the Kerr nonlinearity. The intrinsically broadband nature of parametric gain makes it possible to generate discrete comb modes over a 500-nm-wide span (approximately 70 THz) around 1,550 nm without relying on any external spectral broadening. Optical-heterodyne-based measurements reveal that cascaded parametric interactions give rise to an optical frequency comb, overcoming passive cavity dispersion. The uniformity of the mode spacing has been verified to within a relative experimental precision of 7.3 x 10(-18). In contrast to femtosecond mode-locked lasers, this work represents a step towards a monolithic optical frequency comb generator, allowing considerable reduction in size, complexity and power consumption. Moreover, the approach can operate at previously unattainable repetition rates, exceeding 100 GHz, which are useful in applications where access to individual comb modes is required, such as optical waveform synthesis, high capacity telecommunications or astrophysical spectrometer calibration.},

Several theoretical models for the comb generation have been proposed; however, they do not comprehensively address experimental results that show a variety of independent comb generation mechanisms. Here, we present frequency-domain experiments that illuminate the transition of microcombs into phase-locked states, which show characteristics of injection locking between ensembles of comb modes. In addition, we demonstrate the existence of equidistant optical frequency combs that are phase stable but have nondeterministic phase relationships between individual comb modes.},

As a result, we demonstrate a 10 GHz frequency comb with over 100 lines in a 10 dB bandwidth in which a record 75 lines are within a flatness of 1 dB. The cascaded four-wave mixing process increases the bandwidth of the initial comb generated by the modulation of a CW laser by a factor of five. The broadband comb has approximately quadratic spectral phase, which is compensated upon propagation in single-mode fiber, resulting in a 10 GHz train of 940 fs pulses.},

The number of comb lines that can be generated is limited by the power handling capability of the phase modulator, and this can be scaled without compromising the spectral flatness. Furthermore, the spectral phase of the generated combs in our scheme is almost purely quadratic, which, as we will demonstrate, allows for high-quality pulse compression using only single-mode fiber.},

abstract = {Precise measurements of the frequencies of light waves have become common with mode-locked laser frequency combs 1 . Despite their huge success, optical frequency combs currently remain bulky and expensive laboratory devices. Integrated photonic microresonators are promising candidates for comb generators in out-of-the-lab applications, with the potential for reductions in cost, power consumption and size 2 . Such advances will signi ﬁ cantly impact ﬁ elds ranging from spec- troscopy and trace gas sensing 3 to astronomy 4 , communi- cations 5 and atomic time-keeping 6,7 . Yet, in spite of the remarkable progress shown over recent years 8 – 10 , microresona- tor frequency combs ( ‘ microcombs ' ) have been without the key function of direct f– 2 f self-referencing 1 , which enables precise determination of the absolute frequency of each comb line. Here, we realize this missing element using a 16.4 GHz micro- comb that is coherently broadened to an octave-spanning spectrum and subsequently fully phase-stabilized to an atomic clock. We show phase-coherent control of the comb and demonstrate its low-noise operation.},

Here, we report a silicon-chip-based microresonator comb optical clock that converts an optical frequency reference to a microwave signal. A comb spectrum with a 25 THz span is generated with a 2 mm diameter silica disk and broadening in nonlinear fiber. This spectrum is stabilized to rubidium frequency references separated by 3.5 THz by controlling two teeth 108 modes apart. The optical clock's output is the electronically countable 33 GHz microcomb line spacing, which features stability better than the rubidium transitions by the expected factor of 108.

The algorithm that is presented here is an adaptation for use in the nonlinear optics field of the fourth-order Runge-Kutta in the Interaction Picture (RK4IP) method, which was originally developed for studies on Bose-Einstein condensates. The performance of the RK4IP method is validated and compared to a number of conventional methods by modeling both the propagation of a second-order soliton and the generation of supercontinuum radiation.

In addition, it is demonstrated that the width of the pulses obtained from this generator can be narrowed without regard to the gain-linewidth limitation. This kind of pulse generator may be particularly useful for obtaining short optical pulses from low-gain gas lasers, and it is possible to obtain 10 $\backslash$n 10-pps picosecond pulses from a HeSingle Bond signNe 6328-{\AA} laser. {\textcopyright} 1972 The American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {The control of dispersion in fibre optical waveguides is of critical importance to optical fibre communications systems1, 2 and more recently for continuum generation from the ultraviolet to the mid-infrared3, 4, 5. The wavelength at which the group velocity dispersion crosses zero can be set by varying the fibre core diameter or index step2, 6, 7, 8. Moreover, sophisticated methods to manipulate higher-order dispersion so as to shape and even flatten the dispersion over wide bandwidths are possible using multi-cladding fibres9, 10, 11. Here we introduce design and fabrication techniques that allow analogous dispersion control in chip-integrated optical microresonators, and thereby demonstrate higher-order, wide-bandwidth dispersion control over an octave of spectrum. Importantly, the fabrication method we employ for dispersion control simultaneously permits optical Q factors above 100 million, which is critical for the efficient operation of nonlinear optical oscillators. Dispersion control in high-Q systems has become of great importance in recent years with increased interest in chip-integrable optical frequency combs},

Nonlinear refraction and absorption result instead from the interplay between the real and imaginary parts of the first- and third-order susceptibilities of the material. This effect is illustrated in the case of a metal–dielectric nanocomposite for which n2 and $\beta$ values were experimentally obtained by Z-scan measurements and for which the use of the new formulas for $\chi$R(3) and $\chi$I(3) yield a large correction and a sign reversal for $\chi$I(3).},

Pulse formation is shown to play a critical role in comb generation, and we find conditions under which single pulses (dissipative solitons) and multiple pulses (rolls) form.

abstract = {We report on bidirectional frequency conversion between the microwave and optical domains using electro-optics. Advances in communications, time keeping, and quantum sensing have all come to depend upon the coherent interoperation of light wave and microwave signals. To connect these domains, which are separated by a factor of 10,000 in frequency, requires specialized technology that has until now only been achieved by ultrafast mode-locked lasers. In contrast, electro-optic modulation (EOM) combs arise deterministically by imposing microwave-rate oscillations on a continuous-wave laser. Here we demonstrate electro-optic generation of a 160 THz bandwidth supercontinuum and realize f-2f self-referencing. Coherence of the supercontinuum is achieved through optical filtering of electronic noise on the seed EOM comb. The mode frequencies of the supercontinuum are derived from the electronic oscillator and they achieve {\textless}5×10−14 fractional accuracy and stability, which opens a novel regime for tunable combs with wide mode spacing apart from the requirements of mode locking.},

abstract = {Continuous-wave laser driven Kerr-nonlinear, optical microresonators have enabled a variety of novel applications and phenomena including the generation of optical frequency combs, ultra-low noise microwaves, as well as, ultra-short optical pulses. In this work we break with the paradigm of the continuous-wave optical drive and use instead periodic, pico-second optical pulses. We observe the deterministic generation of stable femtosecond dissipative cavity solitons on-top of the resonantly enhanced driving pulse. Surprisingly, the soliton pulse locks to the driving pulse enabling direct all-optical control of both the soliton's repetition rate and carrier-envelope offset frequency without the need for any actuation on the microresonator. When compared to both continuous-wave driven microresonators and non-resonant pulsed supercontinuum generation, this new approach is substantially more efficient and can yield broadband frequency combs at femto-Joule driving pulse energies and average laser powers significantly below the parametric threshold power of continuous-wave driven microresonators. The presented results bridge the fields of continuous-wave driven resonant and pulse-driven non-resonant nonlinear optics. They enables micro-photonic pulse compression, ultra-efficient low noise frequency comb and resonant supercontinuum generation for applications including optical data transfer and optical spectroscopy. From a scientific perspective the results open a new horizon for nonlinear photonics driven by temporally and spectrally structured light.},
