 \chapter{EOM Combs}\label{chap:EOMCombs}

In this chapter, I discuss the generation of high-repetition-rate frequency combs through electro-optic modulation of a continuous-wave laser---so-called EOM combs \cite{Kobayashi1972,Kourogi1993,Murata2000,Sakamoto2007,Morohashi2008,Ishizawa2010,Wu2010,Supradeepa2012,Metcalf2013,Wu2013}. This scheme represents an alternative to parametric generation of high-repetition-rate combs in Kerr resonators, and as the technology matures it will likely find a niche in the application space that leverages its long-term stability, lack of moving parts, and possibility for robust turn-key operation. First I present the operational principle, followed by experimental results that represent the first $f-2f$ self-referencing of a comb of this kind. Then I provide a discussion of the noise processes specific to the EOM comb, the investigation and mitigation of which is a significant contribution of the work described here. I conclude with a brief outlook for the technology.

\section{Principle of operation}
At its simplest, an EOM comb is a set of lines generated by passing a CW `seed' laser through cascaded phase and intensity modulators to generate a train of chirped pulses. After this initial step, the pulse train may be propagated through a dispersive medium to temporally compress the pulses, and they can be subsequently spectrally broadened. A generic expression for the electric field before temporal compression results from the product of carrier field $E_oe^{i\omega_ct}$ with operators
%\begin{align} \frac{1}{2}\left\{e^{i\phi_{DC}+i\phi_{RF}\sin{(\omega_{rep}t+\phi_{IMPM})}}+\mathrm{exp}\left[-i\phi_{DC}-i\phi_{RF}\sin{(\omega_{rep}t+\phi_{IMPM})}\right]\right\}\\
%=\cos\left(\phi_{DC}+\phi_{RF} \sin(\omega_{rep}t+\phi_{IMPM})\right),
%\end{align} 
\begin{equation}
\frac{e^{i\Phi(t)}+e^{-i\Phi(t)}}{2}=\cos\Phi(t),
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\Phi(t)=\phi_{DC}+\phi_{RF}\sin{(\omega_{rep}t+\phi_{IMPM})}
\end{equation}
representing the intensity modulation and 
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{exp}\left[i\delta_{PM} \sin{\omega_{rep} t}\right]
\end{equation} representing the phase modulation. Here $E_o$ and $\omega_c$ are the complex amplitude and the carrier frequency of the seed laser. The phases  $\phi_{DC}$ and $\phi_{RF}$ represent the DC bias and depth of the intensity modulation, respectively, which experimentally are sourced from a DC power supply and an RF synthesizer. Writing the intensity-modulation operator as the sum of exponentials reveals the physical origin of intensity modulation as phase modulation in two paths with opposite sign. The phase-modulation index, which sets the initial bandwidth of the EOM comb, is $\delta_{PM}$. The comb's repetition rate is $f_{rep}=\omega_{rep}/2\pi$, with $\omega_{rep}$ the angular frequency of the phase and intensity modulation. In practice it is useful to derive these signals from the same synthesizer. The phase $\phi_{IMPM}$ represents a phase difference between the IM and PM operators arising from path-length differences, which can be controlled via the insertion of a phase shifter in one electrical path.

Light blue line (plotted with respect to the left axis): Initial intensity profile of a single EOM comb pulse as described by Eq. \ref{eq:EOMC}. Orange (right axis): Instantaneous carrier frequency, which varies about $\omega_c$ by $\pm\delta_{PM}\omega_{rep}$ and increases approximately linearly in time while the pulse amplitude is high. Solid blue (left axis): Pulse resulting from compression of the initial pulse to its transform limit. The temporal duration of this pulse decreases as $\delta_{PM}$ increases as a result of the increased bandwidth of the comb; here the phase-modulation depth $\delta_{PM}=31\pi/4$ is used. The compressed pulse has higher peak power (in this case by a factor of 26.5); for convenient depiction of both pulses the compressed pulse has been rescaled.}
	\label{fig:EOMCconcept}
\end{figure} 

For convenient temporal pulse compression and subsequent spectral broadening of the comb it is desirable to configure the IM and PM to yield a train of 50 $\%$ duty-cycle pulses with normal chirp (temporally increasing carrier frequency). To achieve this, both $\phi_{DC}$ and $\phi_{RF}$ are set to $\pi/4$ and $\phi_{IMPM}$ is set to zero. Experimentally, one can determine the appropriate RF drive power and bias by adjusting the ratios $\eta_1=P_1/P_0$ and $\eta_2=P_2/P_0$ between the first- and second-order sidebands and the carrier to $\eta_1=-7.4$ dB and $\eta_2=-21.3$ dB with only intensity modulation applied to the seed laser.\footnote{This assumes that the modulation is applied to both paths in the intensity modulator with opposite sign; the correct ratios for a Mach-Zehnder intensity modulator with modulation in only one path are $\eta_1=-5.8$ dB and $\eta_2=-12.9$ dB. This difference arises from residual phase modulation on the output field in the latter case. To determine the internal configuration of the modulator, one can examine the action of the bias: if the modulation is applied to both paths with opposite signs, the bias will adjust only the ratios between the odd- and even-order sidebands while leaving the ratios within each group fixed. However, if the modulation is applied to only one path, the bias will change the ratio of each sideband to the carrier. These conclusions are reached by application of various forms of the Jacobi-Anger expansion.} Setting $\phi_{IMPM}$ to either zero or $\pi$ is achieved by examining the optical spectrum of the EOM comb with both IM and PM applied. The spectrum is asymmetric if $\phi_{IMPM}$ is not zero or $\pi$ due to stronger transmission of either the high- or low-frequency components of the phase-modulated seed laser through the intensity modulators. The optical spectrum of the comb, which does not include phase information, is the same for $\phi_{IMPM}=0$ or $\pi$; the difference between the two corresponds to reversal of the field in time or, equivalently, the difference between normal and anomalous chirp. Setting $\phi_{IMPM}$ to zero is accomplished by verifying that the pulses are compressed by propagation in an appropriate length of an anomalously dispersive medium; $\phi_{IMPM}=\pi$ corresponds to anomalous chirp on the initial pulse train, in which case the pulses will not be compressed.

A simplified and illuminating expression for the electric field of a normally-chirped 50 $\%$ duty-cycle pulse train (up to a constant overall phase shift relative to the expressions above) is:
\begin{equation}
E=E_o\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\sin^2{\frac{\omega_{rep}t}{2}}\right)e^{i\omega_ct-i\delta_{PM}\cos{\omega_{rep}t}}. \label{eq:EOMC}
\end{equation}
This can be understood as the product of a time-varying real amplitude $a(t)=E_o\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\sin^2{\frac{\omega_{rep}t}{2}}\right)$ and a phase factor from which the instantaneous carrier frequency $\omega(t)=\omega_c+\omega_{rep}\delta_{PM}\sin{\omega_{rep}t}$ can be calculated. The carrier frequency $\omega(t)$ is increasing when the amplitude $a(t)$ is at its maximum, corresponding to normal chirp on the pulses. Fig. \ref{fig:EOMCconcept} depicts the intensity $|E|^2$ and instantaneous carrier frequency of the field given by Eq. \ref{eq:EOMC}, as well as the intensity profile corresponding to compression of the same spectrum to its transform limit.




\section{Generation of an EOM comb and detection of its carrier-envelope offset frequency}

Here I describe the generation of an EOM comb with 10 GHz repetition rate and subsequent measurement of its carrier-envelope offset frequency. One advantage of the EOM comb scheme is that the generation and spectral broadening of the comb is well understood, and can be modeled accurately. To demonstrate this, I compare the results of simulations of the comb to the experimental output at each stage in the generation process.

The experimental setup is depicted in Fig. \ref{fig:EOMC_Schematic}. The basic experimental scheme consists of the following steps: 1. Initial generation and temporal compression of the EOM comb pulse train; 2. Modest spectral broadening and temporal re-compression, along with propagation through a Fabry-Perot filter cavity for noise reduction (see Sec. \ref{sec:EOMCnoise}); and 3. Octave-spanning supercontinuum generation and detection of the carrier-envelope offset frequency. The results described below represent the first time a frequency comb of this kind has been self-referenced. Key to the success of this approach is the implementation of nonlinear spectral broadening in two stages, which allows the second stage to be seeded with $\sim$130 fs pulses for coherent supercontinuum generation. Noise reduction with the Fabry-Perot filter cavity is also critical for coherent spectral broadening; I describe a characterization of this step below.

To generate the initial train of chirped pulses, a telecommunications-band CW laser is passed through cascaded phase and intensity modulators driven with a 10 GHz microwave signal. The intensity modulator is biased at the 50 \% transmission point and driven with an RF amplitude appropriate for generation of a 50 $\%$ duty-cycle pulse train, as described above;  the phase modulator is driven with modulation depth of $\sim31\pi/4\sim24.3$ rad. The relative phase between the modulators is set such that the phase applied by the phase modulator is at a minimum when the transmission of the intensity modulator is highest; this yields a train of normally-chirped (up-chirped) pulses. Fig. \ref{fig:EOMC_Schematic}, Panel (i) presents a comparison between the simulated and measured spectra for the initial pulse train.

In Stage 1 a train of $\sim$1.5 ps pulses is generated. In Stage 2 these pulses are spectrally broadened and temporally compressed to $\sim$130 fs duration. In Stage 3 an octave-spanning supercontinuum is generated and $f_0$ is detected in an $f-2f$ interferometer. Panel (i) shows the measured spectrum of the comb output by Stage 1 (black), along with a simulation of the same (orange). Panel (ii) shows simulation of the temporal compression of the pulses by propagation in 570 m of single-mode fiber (orange) and to the transform limit (blue).}
	\label{fig:EOMC_Schematic}
\end{figure} 


Next, the chirped pulse train is propagated through 600 m of anomalously-dispersive SMF. The length of SMF that is appropriate for pulse compression depends on the bandwidth of the optical pulses to be compressed; equivalently, it depends on both the phase-modulation depth and the repetition rate of the pulse train. This temporal compression reduces the duration of the optical pulses from $\sim$50 ps to $\sim$ 1.5 ps. A simulation of the resulting intensity profile and a comparison to the spectrum's transform-limited pulse profile is presented in Fig. \ref{fig:EOMC_Schematic}, Panel (ii). 

The compressed pulses are amplified to 400 mW average power in an erbium-doped fiber amplifier and launched into 100 m of HNLF. This section of HNLF has chromatic dispersion that is small and normal; this is carefully chosen to chirp the pulses via self-phase modulation while avoiding soliton-fission dynamics\cite{Dudley2006}. The result is a train of chirped $\sim$1.5 ps pulses exiting the fiber.  In Fig. \ref{fig:EOMC_Broadening}a we present the measured optical spectrum of this pulse train, as well as results of a numerical simulation of the spectral broadening in the 100 m of normally-dispersive HNLF. These simulations are conducted using the nonlinear Schrodinger equation (NLSE) including third order dispersion\cite{Agrawal2007}, taking as initial conditions the calculated intensity profile of the EOM comb pulses shown in Fig. \ref{fig:EOMC_Schematic}(ii). The dispersion values for the HNLF used in the simulation are $D=-0.04$  ps/nm$\cdot$km and $D'=0.003$ ps/nm$^2\cdot$km, close to the values specified by the manufacturer. The simulation method is described in detail in App. \ref{app:numericalsims}.

\end{figure} 

After propagation through the first section of HNLF, the pulses are passed through a high-finesse Fabry-Perot cavity for suppression of optical frequency fluctuations as discussed below. Then the pulses are temporally compressed again, this time using a commercial spatial light modulator (SLM) \cite{Weiner2000}; the SLM separates narrow spectral regions using a grating and passes them through individually controlled delaying elements before recombination. The SLM applies 2\textsuperscript{nd}, 3\textsuperscript{rd}, and 4\textsuperscript{th} order chromatic dispersion, which simulations indicate is sufficient to compress the chirped pulses to $\sim$130 fs, near their transform limit. This is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:EOMC_Broadening}b. While it is convenient, the SLM is not strictly necessary; it would also be possible to compress the pulses via propagation in an appropriate length of SMF. Figs. \ref{fig:EOMC_Broadening}b and c present the compressed intensity profile and the evolution of the intensity profile, respectively, in simulated compression in SMF. Because the pulses are broadband, temporally short, and reasonably high energy, these simulations include the full dispersion profile of SMF and the Kerr nonlinearity.



The temporally compressed $\sim$130 fs pulses are then passed through an intensity modulator functioning as an electro-optic gate for repetition-rate downsampling (see Chapter \ref{chap:PulsePicking}). The gate selectively transmits every fourth pulse, reducing the repetition rate of the pulse train to 2.5 GHz. This facilitates coherent supercontinuum generation in a second stage of spectral broadening by increasing the pulse energy that can be achieved at a given average power. Note that this step is convenient but not strictly necessary, as shown in Ref. \cite{Beha2017}. 

The downsampled 2.5 GHz pulse train is amplified to an average power of 1.4 W, resulting in a train of $\sim$0.56 nJ pulses. This pulse train is propagated through 8 m of hybrid HNLF, yielding the spectrum shown in Fig. \ref{fig:EOMC_Broadening}d. This hybrid HNLF consists of two segments with different dispersion profiles, with each segment serving a different purpose. The first segment is 30 cm long and highly dispersive ($D=6$  ps/nm$\cdot$km), and generates a dispersive wave centered at 1090 nm. The second segment is 7.7 m long and has lower dispersion ($D=1.5$  ps/nm$\cdot$km), and generates a Raman-self-frequency-shifted soliton centered near 2000 nm. It is difficult to achieve quantitative agreement between the simulated and measured supercontinuum spectra due to the sensitivity of the higher-order nonlinear effects (e.g. Raman and self-steepening) on the input parameters. However, the qualitative effect of each of the fibers that make up the hybrid HNLF can be understood by modeling propagation in each section separately. To do this we use the LaserFOAM program \cite{Amorim2009}, which employs the generalized NLSE including Raman scattering, self-steepening, and 2nd- through 4th-order dispersion. The simulations are run independently, and both take as their initial conditions 170 fs sech pulses with 350 pJ energy, close to the energy coupled into the HNLF after accounting for losses. The results of these simulations are plotted in Fig. \ref{fig:EOMC_Broadening}d. 




The supercontinuum generated in the hybrid HNLF is coherent and suitable for $f-2f$ self-referencing. To detect the carrier-envelope offset frequency of the EOM comb, we pass the pulse train through an interferometer consisting of a dichroic mirror, a delay stage in one path, and a 10 mm sample of periodically-poled lithium niobate that generates the second harmonic of supercontinuum light at 2140 nm.  The dichroic mirror and delay stage enable adjustment of the relative timing between the native 1070 nm and doubled 2140 nm components of the supercontinuum so that they are temporally coincident. An optical band-pass filter centered at 1070 nm selects the supercontinuum components required for self-referencing, shown in Fig. \ref{fig:EOMC_f0}a, and impinging the filtered light on a photodetector reveals the carrier-envelope offset frequency of the EOM comb, shown in Fig. \ref{fig:EOMC_Broadening}b. Note that downsampling introduces an ambiguity in the offset frequency due to the increased density of comb modes in the downsampled pulse train; this ambiguity can be removed by measuring the change in measured offset frequency with a change in $f_{rep}=\omega_{rep}/2\pi$ provided by the synthesizer driving the modulators.

\section{Noise considerations in EOM comb generation}\label{sec:EOMCnoise}

An important difference between the EOM comb scheme and other approaches for generation of frequency combs is that the repetition rate is derived from a microwave source and is multiplied directly by a factor $\mu$ to yield the frequency-comb mode with seed-laser-referenced mode number $\mu$. Therefore, the contribution to the frequency noise of mode $\mu$ from the microwave source scales with the $\mu$, and the contribution to the power spectrum of frequency noise scales as $\mu^2$. This presents a challenge in the generation of coherent supercontinuum light, where the modes relevant for $f-2f$ self-referencing are far from the seed laser and $\mu$ is large. The factor by which the noise on the modulation tone $f_{rep}$ is multiplied to determine its contribution to the noise on the measured carrier-envelope offset frequency is the ratio between the comb's carrier frequency (the frequency of the seed laser) and the repetition rate: $\mu=f_c/f_{rep}=$19340 for the 10 GHz comb discussed above (where $f_c=$193.4 THz for a 1550 nm seed laser). This contribution is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:EOMC_noise}a, along with the contribution from the CW seed laser. The noise on $f_{rep}$ results from technical noise on the synthesizer tone at low Fourier frequencies and approaches a white Johnson-Nyquist (thermal) phase-noise floor of -177 dBm/Hz at high Fourier frequencies. Noise in each of these regimes impacts the photodetected $f_0$ signal: low-frequency noise contributes to the linewidth of the comb modes and therefore the $f_0$ signal, while high-frequency noise contributes to a frequency-noise floor on the photodetected signal\cite{DiDomenico2010}. Unmitigated multiplication of this noise floor by the factor $\mu^2=$19340$^2$ leads to a supercontinuum with optical frequency fluctuations that are large enough to prevent detection and measurement of $f_0$. 

To address this problem and enable $f-2f$ self-referencing of our comb, we pass the comb through a Fabry-Perot filter cavity whose free-spectral range is actively stabilized to the comb's mode spacing. The filter cavity's Lorentzian transfer function reduces the optical frequency fluctuations of the comb modes at high frequency---these fluctuations are averaged over the photon lifetime of the cavity. This enables generation of a supercontinuum with resolvable modes that is suitable for $f-2f$ self-referencing and measurement of $f_0$. 

The filter cavity used for this 10 GHz comb has a 7.5 MHz linewidth; equivalently, it has finesse of $\mathcal{F}\sim$1333. The effect of passing the comb through the cavity is demonstrated concretely in Fig. \ref{fig:EOMC_noise}b, where we compare the lineshape of a heterodyne beat between the supercontinuum and a CW laser with 1319 nm wavelength with and without the filter cavity in place. The signal-to-noise ratios for the beat with and without the filter cavity are 40 dB and 17 dB, respectively.

Signal-to-noise ratios for the beat are 17 dB without and 40 dB with the filter cavity.}

We also explore the effect of low-frequency fluctuations in the modulation tone $f_{rep}$ by changing the source of this tone. The $f_0$ signal shown in Fig. \ref{fig:EOMC_f0}b is acquired with a tunable commercial synthesizer providing $f_{rep}$. In Fig. \ref{fig:EOMC_f0_sources} we show the detected $f_0$ signal with a dielectric-resonator oscillator and a sapphire oscillator providing $f_{rep}$; these sources have less low-frequency noise, and the effect of this lower noise is readily apparent in the reduced linewidth of the $f_0$ signal. This indicates the importance of a high-performance microwave oscillator for future deployments of EOM combs.

\section{Outlook}
The EOM comb approach for frequency-comb generation yields combs that are widely tunable and that can be flexibly tailored for specific applications. Because the comb generation is a non-resonant process (up to the optional inclusion of a filter cavity), the comb properties can be manipulated in real time with speed and range that greatly exceeds the capabilities of mode-locked lasers (where repetition-rate adjustment requires manipulation of moving parts) and microcombs (where repetition-rate control via phase modulation as described in Chap. \ref{chap:PMPumping}, for example, is limited to the locking range afforded by the resonator dispersion). This has allowed, for example, the proposal and demonstration of `PHIRE'---Parallel Heterodyne Interferometry via Rep-rate Exchange---which is, essentially, dual-comb spectroscopy \cite{Coddington2016} with a single frequency comb whose repetition-rate is periodically switched \cite{Carlson2018}. 

EOM combs, with their lack of moving parts, also offer robust turn-key operation to a degree that is difficult to achieve with other comb sources. This has made them particularly promising for applications where long-term deployment with maximum up-time is important, such as calibration of astronomical spectrograms \cite{Metcalf2018}. While the necessity of the filter cavity described here to enable $f-2f$ self-referencing is an apparent limitation, there are promising routes towards eliminating this requirement---using a high-power, tunable microwave oscillator could allow self-referencing of a repetition-rate-tunable EOM comb without a filter cavity.
