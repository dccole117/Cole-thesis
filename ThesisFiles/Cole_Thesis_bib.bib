abstract = {The use of microstructured crystals in quasi-phasematched (QPM) nonlinear interactions has enabled operation of nonlinear devices in regimes inaccessible to conventional birefringently phasematched media. This review addresses basic aspects of the theory of QPM interactions, microstructured ferroelectrics and semiconductors for QPM, devices based on QPM media, and a series of techniques based on engineering of QPM gratings to tailor spatial and spectral response of QPM interactions. Because it is not possible in a brief review to do justice to the large body of results that have been obtained with QPM media over the past twenty years, the emphasis in [1] D. S. Hum and M. M. Fejer, Comptes Rendus Phys. 8, 180 (2007).this review will be on aspects of QPM interactions beyond their use simply as highly nonlinear alternatives to conventional birefringent media.

abstract = {Frequency combslight sources that emit a wide spectrum of sharp lines with equally spaced frequencieshave recently become of interest for use in high-capacity optical data transmission. The possibility of producing frequency combs using compact, chip-integrated microresonators promises scalability and practical applicability. Christian Koos et al. make use of a recently developed technique whereby frequency combs are produced by continuously circulating optical solitonswaveforms that preserve their shape during propagationin silicon-based microresonators. They use two interleaved, chip-based frequency combs to demonstrate transmission of a data stream of more than 50 terabits per second on 179 individual optical carriers in telecommunication wavelength bands. The technology could be used to develop efficient, highly scalable communication systems that could help to address the challenge of a continually growing demand for data capacity.},

abstract = {Extremely narrow optical resonances in cold atoms or single trapped ions can be measured with high resolution. A laser locked to such a narrow optical resonance could serve as a highly stable oscillator for an all-optical atomic clock. However, until recently there was no reliable clockwork mechanism that could count optical frequencies of hundreds of terahertz. Techniques using femtosecond-laser frequency combs, developed within the past few years, have solved this problem. The ability to count optical oscillations of more than 1015 cycles per second facilitates high-precision optical spectroscopy, and has led to the construction of an all-optical atomic clock that is expected eventually to outperform today's state-of-the-art caesium clocks.},

Here, we report experiments in which dark pulse combs are formed in normal-dispersion microresonators with mode-interaction-assisted excitation, and mode-locking transitions are observed in the normal-dispersion regime. The mode-interaction-aided excitation of dark pulses appears to occur through a deterministic pathway, in sharp contrast to the situation for bright pulses in the anomalous dispersion region. The ability to mode-lock in the normal-dispersion regime increases the freedom in the microresonator design and may make it possible to extend Kerr comb generation into the visible, where material dispersion is likely to dominate.},

Here, we demonstrate a new resonator with a record Q-factor of 875 million for on-chip devices. The fabrication of our device avoids the requirement for a specialized processing step, which in microtoroid resonators8 has made it difficult to control their size and achieve millimetre- and centimetre-scale diameters. Attaining these sizes is important in applications such as microcombs and potentially also in rotation sensing. As an application of size control, stimulated Brillouin lasers incorporating our device are demonstrated. The resonators not only set a new benchmark for the Q-factor on a chip, but also provide, for the first time, full compatibility of this important device class with conventional semiconductor processing. This feature will greatly expand the range of possible ‘system on a chip' functions enabled by ultrahigh-Q devices.},

The bifurcation diagram of the second soliton ($\psi$-) depends on the dissipation coefficient: if $\gamma${\textless}$\gamma$cr, the $\psi$- is stable for small h and loses its stability via a Hopf bifurcation as h is increased; if $\gamma${\textgreater}$\gamma$cr, the $\psi$- is stable for all h.

abstract = {Optical frequency combs from mode-locked femtosecond lasers have revolutionized the art of counting the frequency of light. They can link optical and microwave frequencies in a single step, and they provide the long missing clockwork for optical atomic clocks. By extending the limits of time and frequency metrology, they enable new tests of fundamental physics laws. Precise comparisons of optical resonance frequencies of atomic hydrogen and other atoms with the microwave frequency of a cesium atomic clock are establishing sensitive limits for possible slow variations of fundamental constants. Optical high harmonic generation is extending frequency comb techniques into the extreme ultraviolet, opening a new spectral territory to precision laser spectroscopy. Frequency comb techniques are also providing a key to attosecond science by offering control of the electric field of ultrafast laser pulses. In our laboratories at Stanford and Garching, the development of new instruments and techniques for precision laser spectroscopy has long been motivated by the goal of ever higher resolution and measurement accuracy in optical spectroscopy of the simple hydrogen atom which permits unique confrontations between experiment and fundamental theory. This lecture recounts these adventures and the evolution of laser frequency comb techniques from my personal perspective.},

abstract = {It was recently demonstrated that broadband quantum cascade lasers can operate as frequency combs. As such, they operate under direct electrical pumping at both mid-infrared and THz frequencies, making them very attractive for dual-comb spectroscopy. Performance levels are continuously improving, with average powers over 100 mW and frequency coverage of 100 cm{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$} in the mid-infrared. In the THz range, 10 mW of average power and 600 GHz of frequency coverage are reported. As a result of the very short upper state lifetime of the gain medium, the mode proliferation in these sources arises from four wave mixing rather than saturable absorption. As a result, their optical output is characterized by the tendency of small intensity modulation of the output power, and the relative phases of the modes to be similar to the ones of a frequency modulated laser. Recent results include the proof of comb operation down to a metrological level, the observation of a Schawlow-Townes broadened linewidth, as well as the first dual-comb spectroscopy measurements. The capability of the structure to integrate monolithically non-linear optical element as well as to operate as a detector show great promise for future chip integration of dual-comb systems.},

abstract = {Dissipative temporal Kerr solitons in optical microresonators enable to convert a continuous wave laser into a train of femtosecond pulses. Of particular interest are single soliton states, whose {\$}\backslashmathrm{\{}sech{\}}{\^{}}{\{}2{\}}{\$} spectral envelope provides a spectrally smooth and low noise optical frequency comb, and that recently have been generated in crystalline, silica, and silicon-nitride resonators. Here, we study the dynamics of multiple soliton states containing {\$}{\{}N{\}}{\$} solitons and report the discovery of a novel, yet simple mechanism which makes it possible to reduce deterministically the number of solitons, one by one, i.e. {\$}{\{}N\backslash! \backslashto\backslash! N\backslash!-\backslash!1\backslash! \backslashto\backslash! \backslashdots \backslash!\backslashto\backslash! 1{\}}{\$}. By applying weak phase modulation, we directly characterize the soliton state via a double-resonance response. The dynamical probing demonstrates that transitions occur in a predictable way, and thereby enables us to map experimentally the underlying multi-stability diagram of dissipative Kerr solitons. These measurements reveal the "lifted" degeneracy of soliton states as a result of the power-dependent thermal shift of the cavity resonance (i.e. the thermal nonlinearity). The experimental results are in agreement with theoretical and numerical analysis that incorporate the thermal nonlinearity. By studying two different microresonator platforms (integrated {\$}\backslashmathrm{\{}Si{\_}{\{}3{\}}N{\_}{\{}4{\}}{\}}{\$} microresonators and crystalline {\$}\backslashmathrm{\{}MgF{\_}{\{}2{\}}{\}}{\$} resonators) we confirm that these effects have a universal nature. Beyond elucidating the fundamental dynamical properties of dissipative Kerr solitons the observed phenomena are also of practical relevance, providing a manipulation toolbox which enables to sequentially reduce, monitor and stabilize the number {\$}{\{}N{\}}{\$} of solitons, preventing it from decay. Achieving reliable single soliton operation and stabilization in this manner in optical resonators is imperative to applications.},

abstract = {Continuous-wave laser driven Kerr-nonlinear, optical microresonators have enabled a variety of novel applications and phenomena including the generation of optical frequency combs, ultra-low noise microwaves, as well as, ultra-short optical pulses. In this work we break with the paradigm of the continuous-wave optical drive and use instead periodic, pico-second optical pulses. We observe the deterministic generation of stable femtosecond dissipative cavity solitons on-top of the resonantly enhanced driving pulse. Surprisingly, the soliton pulse locks to the driving pulse enabling direct all-optical control of both the soliton's repetition rate and carrier-envelope offset frequency without the need for any actuation on the microresonator. When compared to both continuous-wave driven microresonators and non-resonant pulsed supercontinuum generation, this new approach is substantially more efficient and can yield broadband frequency combs at femto-Joule driving pulse energies and average laser powers significantly below the parametric threshold power of continuous-wave driven microresonators. The presented results bridge the fields of continuous-wave driven resonant and pulse-driven non-resonant nonlinear optics. They enables micro-photonic pulse compression, ultra-efficient low noise frequency comb and resonant supercontinuum generation for applications including optical data transfer and optical spectroscopy. From a scientific perspective the results open a new horizon for nonlinear photonics driven by temporally and spectrally structured light.},

@article{Parra-Rivas2017,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017, EDP Sciences, SIF, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany. Abstract: Bound states, also called soliton molecules, can form as a result of the interaction between individual solitons. This interaction is mediated through the tails of each soliton that overlap with one another. When such soliton tails have spatial oscillations, locking or pinning between two solitons can occur at fixed distances related with the wavelength of these oscillations, thus forming a bound state. In this work, we study the formation and stability of various types of bound states in the Lugiato-Lefever equation by computing their interaction potential and by analyzing the properties of the oscillatory tails. Moreover, we study the effect of higher order dispersion and noise in the pump intensity on the dynamics of bound states. In doing so, we reveal that perturbations to the Lugiato-Lefever equation that maintain reversibility, such as fourth order dispersion, lead to bound states that tend to separate from one another in time when noise is added. This separation force is determined by the shape of the envelope of the interaction potential, as well as an additional Brownian ratchet effect. In systems with broken reversibility, such as third order dispersion, this ratchet effect contin ues to push solitons within a bound state apart. However, the force generated by the envelope of the potential is now such that it pushes the solitons towards each other, leading to a null net drift of the solitons.

By adjusting the taper diameter to match the ropagation constant of the mode in the taper with that of the resonant mode of interest, one can couple more than 90{\%} of the light into the sphere.

abstract = {Four long-running currents in laser technology met and merged in 1999–2000. Two of these were the quest toward a stable repetitive sequence of ever-shorter optical pulses and, on the other hand, the quest for the most time-stable, unvarying optical frequency possible. The marriage of UltraFast and UltraStable lasers was brokered mainly by two international teams and became exciting when a special "designer" microstructure optical fiber was shown to be nonlinear enough to produce "white light" from the femtosecond laser pulses, such that the output spectrum embraced a full optical octave. Then, for the first time, one could realize an optical frequency interval equal to the comb's lowest frequency, and count out this interval as a multiple of the repetition rate of the femtosecond pulse laser. This "gear-box" connection between the radio frequency standard and any/all optical frequency standards came just as Sensitivity-Enhancing ideas were maturing. The four-way Union empowered an explosion of accurate frequency measurement results in the standards field and prepares the way for refined tests of some of our cherished physical principles, such as the time-stability of some of the basic numbers in physics (e.g., the "fine-structure" constant, the speed of light, certain atomic mass ratios etc.), and the equivalence of time-keeping by clocks based on different physics. The stable laser technology also allows time-synchronization between two independent femtosecond lasers so exact they can be made to appear as if the source were a single laser. By improving pump/probe experiments, one important application will be in bond-specific spatial scanning of biological samples. This next decade in optical physics should be a blast.},

abstract = {We present theoretical and experimental evidence of a universal mechanism through which temporal cavity solitons of externally-driven, passive, Kerr resonators can form robust long-range bound states. These bound states, sometime also referred to as multi-soliton states or soliton crystals in microresonators, require perturbations to the strict Lugiato-Lefever mean field description of temporal cavity solitons. Binding occurs when the perturbation excites a narrowband resonance in the soliton spectrum, which gives long oscillatory tails to the solitons. Those tails can then interlock for a discrete set of temporal separations between the solitons. The universality of this mechanism is demonstrated in fiber ring cavities by providing experimental observations of long-range bound states ensuing from three different perturbations: third-order dispersion (dispersive wave generation), the periodic nature of the cavity (Kelly sidebands), and the random birefringence of the resonator. Sub-picosecond resolution of bound state separations and their dynamics are obtained by using the dispersive Fourier transform technique. Good agreement with theoretical models, including a new vector mean-field model, is also reported.},

abstract = {Self-referencing turns pulsed laser systems into self-referenced frequency combs. Such frequency combs allow counting of optical frequencies and have a wide range of applications. The required optical bandwidth to implement self-referencing is typically obtained via nonlinear broadening in optical fibers. Recent advances in the field of Kerr frequency combs have provided a path towards the development of compact frequency comb sources that provide broadband frequency combs, exhibit microwave repetition rates and that are compatible with on-chip photonic integration. These devices have the potential to significantly expand the use of frequency combs. Yet to date self-referencing of such Kerr frequency combs has only been attained by applying conventional, fiber based broadening techniques. Here we demonstrate external broadening-free self-referencing of a Kerr frequency comb. An optical spectrum that spans two-thirds of an octave is directly synthesized from a continuous wave laser-driven silicon nitride microresonator using temporal dissipative Kerr soliton formation and soliton Cherenkov radiation. Using this coherent bandwidth and two continuous wave transfer lasers in a 2f-3f self-referencing scheme, we are able to detect the offset frequency of the soliton Kerr frequency comb. By stabilizing the repetition rate to a radio frequency reference the self-referenced frequency comb is used to count and track the continuous wave pump laser's frequency. This work demonstrates the principal ability of soliton Kerr frequency combs to provide microwave-to-optical clockworks on a chip.},

abstract = {The control of the broadband frequency comb emitted from a mode-locked femtosecond laser has permitted a wide range of scientific and technological advances--ranging from the counting of optical cycles for next-generation atomic clocks to measurements of phase-sensitive high-field processes. A unique advantage of the stabilized frequency comb is that it provides, in a single laser beam, about a million optical modes with very narrow linewidths and absolute frequency positions known to better than one part in 10(15) (ref. 5). One important application of this vast array of highly coherent optical fields is precision spectroscopy, in which a large number of modes can be used to map internal atomic energy structure and dynamics. However, an efficient means of simultaneously identifying, addressing and measuring the amplitude or relative phase of individual modes has not existed. Here we use a high-resolution disperser to separate the individual modes of a stabilized frequency comb into a two-dimensional array in the image plane of the spectrometer. We illustrate the power of this technique for high-resolution spectral fingerprinting of molecular iodine vapour, acquiring in a few milliseconds absorption images covering over 6 THz of bandwidth with high frequency resolution. Our technique for direct and parallel accessing of stabilized frequency comb modes could find application in high-bandwidth spread-spectrum communications with increased security, high-resolution coherent quantum control, and arbitrary optical waveform synthesis with control at the optical radian level.},

Advances in statistical mechanics (the fundamental formulations of Gibbs and Boltzmann, integral equations and perturbation theories, computer simulations), in knowledge of intermolecular forces, and in experimental techniques; have all contributed to this. Thirty years ago the very existence of liquids seemed a little mysterious; today one can make fairly precise predictions of the solid-liquid-gas phase diagram and of the microscopic and macroscopic static and dynamic properties of liquids. This paper is a survey, with particular emphasis on equilibrium properties, of the theory which underlies that basic understanding, which is now at least comparable with our understanding of the physics of solids.},

Using an optical microresonator frequency comb to establish a coherent link between optical and microwave frequencies will extend optical frequency synthesis and measurements to areas requiring compact form factor, on-chip integration, and comb line spacing in the microwave regime, including coherent telecommunications, astrophysical spectrometer calibration, or microwave photonics. Here we demonstrate a microwave-to-optical link with a microresonator. By using a temporal dissipative single soliton state in an ultrahigh-Q crystalline microresonator that is broadened in highly nonlinear fiber, an optical frequency comb is generated that is self-referenced, allowing us to phase coherently link a 190 THz optical carrier directly to a 14 GHz microwave frequency. Our work demonstrates that precision optical frequency measurements can be realized with compact high-Q microresonators.},

abstract = {Optical frequency combs provide equidistant frequency markers in the infrared, visible and ultraviolet, and can be used to link an unknown optical frequency to a radio or microwave frequency reference. Since their inception, frequency combs have triggered substantial advances in optical frequency metrology and precision measurements and in applications such as broadband laser-based gas sensing and molecular fingerprinting. Early work generated frequency combs by intra-cavity phase modulation; subsequently, frequency combs have been generated using the comb-like mode structure of mode-locked lasers, whose repetition rate and carrier envelope phase can be stabilized. Here we report a substantially different approach to comb generation, in which equally spaced frequency markers are produced by the interaction between a continuous-wave pump laser of a known frequency with the modes of a monolithic ultra-high-Q microresonator via the Kerr nonlinearity. The intrinsically broadband nature of parametric gain makes it possible to generate discrete comb modes over a 500-nm-wide span (approximately 70 THz) around 1,550 nm without relying on any external spectral broadening. Optical-heterodyne-based measurements reveal that cascaded parametric interactions give rise to an optical frequency comb, overcoming passive cavity dispersion. The uniformity of the mode spacing has been verified to within a relative experimental precision of 7.3 x 10(-18). In contrast to femtosecond mode-locked lasers, this work represents a step towards a monolithic optical frequency comb generator, allowing considerable reduction in size, complexity and power consumption. Moreover, the approach can operate at previously unattainable repetition rates, exceeding 100 GHz, which are useful in applications where access to individual comb modes is required, such as optical waveform synthesis, high capacity telecommunications or astrophysical spectrometer calibration.},

Experiments so far have demonstrated two techniques for their excitation, yet both possess drawbacks in the form of system complexity or lack of control over soliton positioning. Here we experimentally demonstrate a new CS writing scheme that alleviates these deficiencies. Specifically, we show that temporal CSs can be excited at arbitrary positions through direct phase modulation of the cavity driving field, and that this technique also allows existing CSs to be selectively erased. Our results constitute the first experimental demonstration of temporal CS excitation via direct phase modulation, as well as their selective erasure (by any means). These advances reduce the complexity of CS excitation and could lead to controlled pulse generation in monolithic microresonators.},

In this regard, dual-comb spectroscopy has emerged as a powerful approach to acquire nearly instantaneous Raman and optical spectra with unprecedented resolution. Spectra are generated directly in the electrical domain and avoid bulky mechanical spectrometers. Recently, a miniature soliton-based comb has emerged that can potentially transfer the dual-comb method to a chip platform. Unlike earlier microcombs, these new devices achieve high-coherence, pulsed mode locking. They generate broad, reproducible spectral envelopes, which is essential for dual-comb spectroscopy. Here, dual-comb spectroscopy is demonstrated using these devices. This work shows the potential for integrated, high signal-to-noise spectroscopy with fast acquisition rates.},

Our numerical simulations of a variant of the Lugiato-Lefever equation (LLE) suggest that modulating the input phase at a frequency equal to the resonator free spectral range and at modest modulation depths provides a deterministic route toward soliton formation in WGM resonators without undergoing a chaotic phase. We show that the generated solitonic state is sustained when the modulation is turned off adiabatically. Our results support parametric seeding as a powerful means of control, in addition to input pump power and pump-resonance detuning, over frequency comb generation in WGM resonators. Our findings also help pave the way toward ultrashort pulse formation on a chip.},

Advances in communications, time keeping, and quantum sensing have all come to depend upon the coherent interoperation of light wave and microwave signals. To connect these domains, which are separated by a factor of 10,000 in frequency, requires specialized technology that has until now only been achieved by ultrafast mode-locked lasers. In contrast, electro-optic modulation (EOM) combs arise deterministically by imposing microwave-rate oscillations on a continuous-wave laser. Here we demonstrate electro-optic generation of a 160 THz bandwidth supercontinuum and realize f-2f self-referencing. Coherence of the supercontinuum is achieved through optical filtering of electronic noise on the seed EOM comb. The mode frequencies of the supercontinuum are derived from the electronic oscillator and they achieve {\textless}5×10−14 fractional accuracy and stability, which opens a novel regime for tunable combs with wide mode spacing apart from the requirements of mode locking.},

Emission of soliton induced Cherenkov radiation caused by higher order dispersion broadens the spectral bandwidth to 2/3 of an octave, sufficient for self referencing, in excellent agreement with recent theoretical predictions and the broadest coherent microresonator frequency comb generated to date. The ability to preserve coherence over a broad spectral bandwidth using soliton induced Cherenkov radiation marks a critical milestone in the development of planar optical frequency combs, enabling on one hand application in e.g. coherent communications, broadband dual comb spectroscopy and Raman spectral imaging, while on the other hand significantly relaxing dispersion requirements for broadband microresonator frequency combs and providing a path for their generation in the visible and UV. Our results underscore the utility and effectiveness of planar microresonator frequency comb technology, that offers the potential to make frequency metrology accessible beyond specialized laboratories.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The optical frequency comb technology is one of the most important breakthrough in photonics in recent years. This concept has revolutionized the science of ultra-stable lightwave and microwave signal generation. These combs were originally generated using ultrafast mode-locked lasers, but in the past decade, a simple and elegant alternativewas proposed,which consisted in pumping an ultra-high-Q optical resonator with Kerr nonlinearity using a continuous-wave laser. When optimal conditions are met, the intracavity pump photons are redistributed via four-wave mixing to the neighboring cavity modes, thereby creating the so-called Kerr optical frequency comb. Beyond being energy-efficient, conceptually simple, and structurally robust, Kerr comb generators are very compact devices (millimetric down to micrometric size) which can be integrated on a chip. They are, therefore, considered as very promising candidates to replace femtosecond mode-locked lasers for the generation of broadband and coherent optical frequency combs in the spectral domain, or equivalently, narrow optical pulses in the temporal domain. These combs are, moreover, expected to provide breakthroughs in many technological areas, such as integrated photonics, metrology, optical telecommunications, and aerospace engineering. The purpose of this review article is to present a comprehensive survey of the topic of Kerr optical frequency combs.We provide an overview of the main theoretical and experimental results that have been obtained so far. We also highlight the potential of Kerr combs for current or prospective applications, and discuss as well some of the open challenges that are to be met at the fundamental and applied level.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

It is shown that the strength of the spectral correlations in the shot noise depends on the optical pulsewidth, and that these correlations can create orders-of-magnitude imbalance between the shot-noise-limited amplitude and phase noise of photonically generated microwave carriers. It is also shown that only by accounting for spectral correlations can shot noise be equated with the fundamental quantum limit in the detection of optical pulse-to-pulse timing jitter.},

The cavity solitons are trapped into specific time slots through a phase modulation of the holding beam, and moved around in time by manipulating the phase profile. We report both continuous and discrete manipulations of the temporal positions of picosecond light pulses, with the ability to simultaneously and independently control several pulses within a train. We also study the transient drifting dynamics and show complete agreement with theoretical predictions. Our study demonstrates how the unique particle-like characteristics of cavity solitons can be leveraged to achieve unprecedented control over light.

Most research employs microresonators with anomalous dispersion, for which modulation instability is believed to play a key role in initiation of the comb. Comb generation in normal-dispersion microresonators has also been reported but is less well understood. Here, we report a detailed investigation of few-moded, normal-dispersion silicon nitride microresonators, showing that mode coupling can strongly modify the local dispersion, even changing its sign. We demonstrate a link between mode coupling and initiation of comb generation by showing experimentally the pinning of one of the initial comb sidebands near a mode-crossing frequency. Associated with this route to comb formation, we observe direct generation of coherent, bandwidth-limited pulses at repetition rates down to 75 GHz, without the need to first pass through a chaotic state. Our results with normal-dispersion devices highlight mode interactions as a beneficial tool for comb initiation and pulse formation.},

Quantum non-demolition measurements are discussed, with particular reference to their use in high sensitivity absorption experiments. Finally, sources of some other types of non-classical light and possible experiments making use of these sources are considered.},

abstract = {Strongly interacting solitons confined to an optical resonator would offer unique capabilities for experiments in communication, computation, and sensing with light. Here we report on the discovery of soliton crystals in monolithic Kerr microresonators-spontaneously and collectively ordered ensembles of co-propagating solitons whose interactions discretize their allowed temporal separations. We unambiguously identify and characterize soliton crystals through analysis of their 'fingerprint' optical spectra, which arise from spectral interference between the solitons. We identify a rich space of soliton crystals exhibiting crystallographic defects, and time-domain measurements directly confirm our inference of their crystal structure. The crystallization we observe is explained by long-range soliton interactions mediated by resonator mode degeneracies, and we probe the qualitative difference between soliton crystals and a soliton liquid that forms in the absence of these interactions. Our work explores the rich physics of monolithic Kerr resonators in a new regime of dense soliton occupation and offers a way to greatly increase the efficiency of Kerr combs; further, the extreme degeneracy of the configuration space of soliton crystals suggests an implementation for a robust on-chip optical buffer.},

We demonstrate an all-optical atomic clock referenced to the 1.064-petahertz transition of a single trapped 199Hg+ ion. A clockwork based on a mode-locked femtosecond laser provides output pulses at a 1-gigahertz rate that are phase-coherently locked to the optical frequency.

The new class of Kerr-frequency comb sources, based on parametric frequency conversion in optical microresonators, can complement conventional systems in applications requiring high repetition rates such as direct comb spectroscopy, spectrometer calibration, arbitrary optical waveform generation and advanced telecommunications. However, a severe limitation in experiments working towards practical systems is phase noise, observed in the form of linewidth broadening, multiple repetition-rate beat notes and loss of temporal coherence. These phenomena are not explained by the current theory of Kerr comb formation, yet understanding this is crucial to the maturation of Kerr comb technology.

However, this would require measurements of Doppler velocity drifts of approximately 1 centimeter per second per year, and astronomical spectrographs have not yet been calibrated to this tolerance. We demonstrated the first use of a laser frequency comb for wavelength calibration of an astronomical telescope. Even with a simple analysis, absolute calibration is achieved with an equivalent Doppler precision of approximately 9 meters per second at approximately 1.5 micrometers-beyond state-of-the-art accuracy. We show that tracking complex, time-varying systematic effects in the spectrograph and detector system is a particular advantage of laser frequency comb calibration. This technique promises an effective means for modeling and removal of such systematic effects to the accuracy required by future experiments to see direct evidence of the universe's putative acceleration.},

abstract = {Since 1998, the interaction of precision spectroscopy and ultrafast laser science has led to several notable accomplishments. Femtosecond laser optical frequency 'combs' (evenly spaced spectral lines) have revolutionized the measurement of optical frequencies and enabled optical atomic clocks. The same comb techniques have been used to control the waveform of ultrafast laser pulses, which permitted the generation of single attosecond pulses, and have been used in a recently demonstrated 'oscilloscope' for light waves. Here we demonstrate intra-cavity high harmonic generation in the extreme ultraviolet, which promises to lead to another joint frontier of precision spectroscopy and ultrafast science. We have generated coherent extreme ultraviolet radiation at a repetition frequency of more than 100 MHz, a 1,000-fold improvement over previous experiments. At such a repetition rate, the mode spacing of the frequency comb, which is expected to survive the high harmonic generation process, is large enough for high resolution spectroscopy. Additionally, there may be many other applications of such a quasi-continuous compact and coherent extreme ultraviolet source, including extreme ultraviolet holography, microscopy, nanolithography and X-ray atomic clocks.},

To accommodate low-power and mobile application platforms, our phase-locked frequency-comb system operates with {\textless}250 mW of chip-coupled power.

Since the relative detuning of the pump laser and resonator primarily determines soliton dynamics, we devise an offset Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH) frequency-locking system to directly stabilize and tune it with radiofrequency precision. PDH locking not only guides Kerr-soliton formation from a cold resonator, but it enables systematic exploration of the detuning-dependent thermal and nonlinear processes that govern the frequency comb and opens a path to decouple the repetition and carrier-envelope-offset frequencies of the comb. In particular, we demonstrate phase stabilization of both these degrees-of-freedom with a single-soliton Kerr comb to a fractional frequency precision below 10{\^{}}-16, to be compatible with optical-timekeeping technology. Moreover, we investigate the fundamental role that residual detuning noise plays in the spectral purity of Kerr-comb microwave generation.},

abstract = {We utilize silicon-nitride waveguides to self-reference a telecom-wavelength fiber frequency comb through supercontinuum generation, using 11.3 mW of optical power incident on the chip. This is approximately ten times lower than conventional approaches using nonlinear fibers and is enabled by low-loss ({\textless}2 dB) input coupling and the high nonlinearity of silicon nitride, which can provide two octaves of spectral broadening with incident energies of only 110 pJ. Following supercontinuum generation, self-referencing is accomplished by mixing 780-nm dispersive-wave light with the frequency-doubled output of the fiber laser. In addition, at higher optical powers, we demonstrate f-to-3f self-referencing directly from the waveguide output by the interference of simultaneous supercontinuum and third harmonic generation, without the use of an external doubling crystal or interferometer. These hybrid comb systems combine the performance of fiber-laser frequency combs with the high nonlinearity and compactness of photonic waveguides, and should lead to low-cost, fully stabilized frequency combs for portable and space-borne applications.},

@article{Pasquazi2018,
abstract = {The quest towards the integration of ultra-fast, high-precision optical clocks is reflected in the large number of high-impact papers on the topic published in the last few years. This interest has been catalysed by the impact that high-precision optical frequency combs (OFCs) have had on metrology and spectroscopy in the last decade []. OFCs are often referred to as optical rulers: their spectra consist of a precise sequence of discrete and equally-spaced spectral lines that represent precise marks in frequency. Their importance was recognised worldwide with the 2005 Nobel Prize being awarded to T.W. H{\"{a}}nsch and J. Hall for their breakthrough in OFC science []. They demonstrated that a coherent OFC source with a large spectrum - covering at least one octave - can be stabilised with a self-referenced approach, where the frequency and the phase do not vary and are completely determined by the source physical parameters. These fully stabilised OFCs solved the challenge of directly measuring optical frequencies and are now exploited as the most accurate time references available, ready to replace the current standard for time. Very recent advancements in the fabrication technology of optical micro-cavities [] are contributing to the development of OFC sources. These efforts may open up the way to realise ultra-fast and stable optical clocks and pulsed sources with extremely high repetition-rates, in the form of compact and integrated devices. Indeed, the fabrication of high-quality factor (high-Q) micro-resonators, capable of dramatically amplifying the optical field, can be considered a photonics breakthrough that has boosted not only the scientific investigation of OFC sources [] but also of optical sensors and compact light modulators [].In this framework, the demonstration of planar high-Q resonators, compatible with silicon technology [], has opened up a unique opportunity for these devices to provide entirely new capabilities for photonic-integrated technologies. Indeed, it is well acknowledged by the electronics industry that future generations of computer processing chips will inevitably require an extremely high density of copper-based interconnections, significantly increasing the chip power dissipation to beyond practical levels []; hence, conventional approaches to chip design must undergo radical changes. On-chip optical networks, or optical interconnects, can offer high speed and low energy per-transferred-bit, and micro-resonators are widely seen as a key component to interface the electronic world with photonics.Many information technology industries have recently focused on the development of integrated ring resonators to be employed for electrically-controlled light modulators [], greatly advancing the maturity of micro-resonator technology as a whole. Recently [], the demonstration of OFC sources in micro-resonators fabricated in electronic (i.e. in complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS)) compatible platforms has given micro-cavities an additional appeal, with the possibility of exploiting them as light sources in microchips. This scenario is creating fierce competition in developing highly efficient OFC generators based on micro-cavities which can radically change the nature of information transport and processing. Even in telecommunications, perhaps a more conventional environment for optical technologies, novel time-division multiplexed optical systems will require extremely stable optical clocks at ultra-high pulse repetition-rates towards the THz scale. Furthermore, arbitrary pulse generators based on OFC [] are seen as one of the most promising solutions for this next generation of high-capacity optical coherent communication systems. This review will summarise the recent exciting achievements in the field of micro-combs, namely optical frequency combs based on high-Q micro-resonators, with a perspective on both the potential of this technology, as well as the open questions and challenges that remain.},

abstract = {Pulse formation in an all-solid-state passively mode-locked neodymium glass fiber laser is investigated by employing characterization techniques in the time, optical, and radio-frequency domains. The pulses are generated by a combination of passive amplitude modulation arising from nonlinear polarization evolution and passive frequency modulation due to quasi-soliton-like pulse shaping. Several distinct operation modes for ultrashort pulse generation are described and pulses as short as 38 fs are directly generated in the cavity},

The experiment compared two clocks, one based on the optical D2 transition in Rb, and another on hyperfine splitting in Cs. This represents the first frequency comb based optical clock operation in space, which is an important milestone for future satellite-based precision metrology. Based on the approach demonstrated here, future space-based precision metrology can be improved by orders of magnitude when referencing to state-of-the-art optical clock transitions.},

@article{Coburn2018,
abstract = {Identification and quantification of trace-gas sources is amajor challenge for understanding and regulating air quality and greenhouse gas emissions. Current approaches provide either continuous but localized monitoring, or quasi- instantaneous “snapshot-in-time” regional monitoring. There is a need for emissions detection that provides both continuous and regional coverage, because sources and sinks can be episodic and spatially variable. We field deploy a dual frequency comb laser spectrometer for the first time, enabling an observing system that provides continuous detection of trace-gas sources over multiple-square-kilometer regions. Field tests simulating methane emissions from oil and gas production demonstrate detection and quantification of a 1.6gmin−1 source (less than the average emis- sions from a small pneumatic controller) from a distance of 1 km, and the ability to discern two leaks among a field of many potential sources. The technology achieves the goal of detecting, quantifying, and attributing emissions sources continuously through time, over large areas, and at emissions rates ∼1000 × lower than current regional approaches. It therefore provides a useful tool for monitoring and mitigating undesirable sources and closes a major information gap in the atmospheric sciences.},

The frequency comb has residual optical linewidths of {\textless} 1 Hz, sub-radian residual optical phase noise, and residual pulse-to-pulse timing jitter of 2.4 - 5 fs, when locked to an optical reference. This fully phase-locked frequency comb has been successfully operated in a moving vehicle with 0.5 g peak accelerations and on a shaker table with a sustained 0.5 g rms integrated acceleration, while retaining its optical coherence and 5-fs-level timing jitter. This frequency comb should enable metrological measurements outside the laboratory with the precision and accuracy that are the hallmarks of comb-based systems.},

@article{Sinclair2015,
abstract = {We describe the design, fabrication, and performance of a self-referenced, optically coherent fre-quency comb. The system robustness is derived from a combination of an optics package based on polarization-maintaining fiber, saturable absorbers for mode-locking, high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) detection of the control signals, and digital feedback control for frequency stabilization. The output is phase-coherent over a 1-2$\mu$ m octave-spanning spectrum with a pulse repetition rate of ∼200 MHz and a residual pulse-to-pulse timing jitter{\textless} 3 fs well within the requirements of most frequency-comb applications. Digital control enables phase coherent operation for over 90 h, critical for phase-sensitive applications such as timekeeping. We show that this phase-slip free operation follows the fundamental limit set by the SNR of the control signals. Performance metrics from three nearly identical combs are presented. This laptop-sized comb should enable a wide-range of applications beyond the laboratory.},

abstract = {We discuss experimental and theoretical aspects of a low-noise fiber-laser frequency comb, including the experimental configuration and the major contributions to the frequency noise and linewidth of the individual comb modes. Intracavity noise sources acting on the mode-locked laser determine the free-running comb linewidth and include environmental changes, pump noise, and amplified spontaneous emission (ASE). Extracavity noise sources acting outside of the laser typically determine the signal-to-noise ratio on the comb lines and include environmental effects, shot noise, and noise generated during supercontinuum generation. Feedback strongly suppresses these intracavity noise contributions, yielding a system that operates with comb linewidths and timing jitter below the quantum limit set by the intracavity ASE. Finally, we discuss correlations in the residual noise across a phase-locked comb. (c) 2007 Optical Society of America.},

We combine periodic variations in the 87Sr clock frequency with 199Hg+ and H-maser data to test local position invariance by obtaining the strongest limits to date on gravitational-coupling coefficients for the fine-structure constant alpha, electron-proton mass ratio mu, and light quark mass. Furthermore, after 199Hg+, 171Yb+, and H, we add 87Sr as the fourth optical atomic clock species to enhance constraints on yearly drifts of alpha and mu.},
